        <h2>Investors cautious as Trump signals new tariffs</h2>
        <img src="image.jpg.webp" alt="">
        <p>Global stock markets swayed on Tuesday, as investors tried to digest what US President Donald Trump will do on tariffs.
            In his inaugural address Trump stopped short of announcing fresh import taxes on his first day in office, though he later said new tariffs on Mexico and Canada could come on 1 February.</p>
            <p>Shares in the US and Europe opened slightly higher, while those in Asia saw modest gains.
                Trump has promised an ambitious agenda - including trade reforms, lower taxes and cuts to government regulations - which has the potential to boost company profits.</p>
                <p>But some economists have warned that the measures may also raise inflation, which in turn could force the Federal Reserve to increase interest rates.
                    The dollar, which had fallen on Monday after the inauguration, regained some ground against some other major currencies, including the pound and the euro.
                    Trump had previously threatened new tariffs on Canada, Mexico and China on day one of his presidency. While they did not materialise on Monday, they are still on the agenda.
